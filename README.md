# Philips Hue devices for TimeSquAir and the Thingbox

These NodeRED nodes allow you to **use Philips Hue devices without technical knowledge**, by removing most of mandatory code.

**The Thingbox** (http://theThingbox.io) is a ready to flash RaspberryPi image that contains Node-RED ready to use.
The Thingbox is the easiest and quickiest way to get Node-RED running on a Pi. All Free.

These nodes also work on stock NodeRED.
